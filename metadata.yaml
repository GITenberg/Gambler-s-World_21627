description: Greylorn - Commander Greylorn must find a lost colony and beg it to come
  to Earths aid. But before he can accomplish this he must first survive a mutiny
  aboard his own star ship. A taut story of interplanetary intrigue and adventure!
  It Could Be Anything - ?The body shifted, rotating stiffly, then tilted upright.
  ?The sun struck through the amber shape that flowed down to form itself into the
  crested wave.? IT COULD BE ANYTHING. Gambler?s World - Unless Retief and his colleague
  Magnan get to the bottom of Zorn?s gambling operation and play their own games,
  a whole spaceship?s worth
