<p class="initial top">R<span class="smcap">etief</span> paused before a
tall mirror to check the overlap of the four sets of lapels that
ornamented the vermilion cutaway of a First Secretary and Consul.</p>

<p>"Come along, Retief," Magnan said. "The Ambassador has a word to say
to the staff before we go in."</p>

<p>"I hope he isn't going to change the spontaneous speech he plans to
make when the Potentate impulsively suggests a trade agreement along the
lines they've been discussing for the last two months."</p>

<p>"Your derisive attitude is uncalled for, Retief," Magnan said
sharply. "I think you realize it's delayed your promotion in the
Corps."</p>

<p>Retief took a last glance in the mirror. "I'm not sure I want a
promotion," he said. "It would mean more lapels."</p>

<p>Ambassador Crodfoller pursed his lips, waiting until Retief and
Magnan took places in the ring of Terrestrial diplomats around him.</p>

<p>"A word of caution only, gentlemen," he said. "Keep always foremost
in your minds the necessity for our identification with the Nenni Caste.
Even a hint of familiarity with lower echelons could mean the failure of
the mission. Let us remember that the Nenni represent authority here on
Petreac. Their traditions must be observed, whatever our personal
preferences. Let's go along now. The Potentate will be making his
entrance any moment."</p>

<p>Magnan came to Retief's side as they moved toward the salon.</p>

<p>"The Ambassador's remarks were addressed chiefly to you, Retief," he
said. "Your laxness in these matters is notorious. Naturally, I believe
firmly in democratic principles myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you ever had a feeling, Mr. Magnan, that there's a lot going on
here that we don't know about?"</p>

<p>Magnan nodded. "Quite so. Ambassador Crodfoller's point exactly.
Matters which are not of concern to the Nenni are of no concern to
us."</p>

<p>"Another feeling I get is that the Nenni aren't very bright. Now
suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not given to suppositions, Retief. We're here to implement the
policies of the Chief of Mission. And I should dislike to be in the
shoes of a member of the staff whose conduct jeopardized the agreement
that will be concluded here tonight."</p>

<p class="initial">A bearer with a tray of drinks rounded a fluted
column, shied as he confronted the diplomats, fumbled the tray, grabbed
and sent a glass crashing to the floor.</p>

<p>Magnan leaped back, slapping at the purple cloth of his pants leg.
Retief's hand shot out to steady the tray. The servant rolled terrified
eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll take one of these, now that you're here," Retief said. He took
a glass from the tray, winking at the servant.</p>

<p>"No harm done," he said. "Mr. Magnan's just warming up for the big
dance."</p>

<p>A Nenni major-domo bustled up, rubbing his hands politely.</p>

<p>"Some trouble here?" he said. "What happened, Honorables, what,
what...."</p>

<p>"The blundering idiot," Magnan spluttered. "How dare&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're quite an actor, Mr. Magnan," Retief said. "If I didn't know
about your democratic principles, I'd think you were really mad."</p>

<p>The servant ducked his head and scuttled away.</p>

<p>"Has this fellow...." The major-domo eyed the retreating bearer.</p>

<p>"I dropped my glass," Retief said. "Mr. Magnan's upset because he
hates to see liquor wasted."</p>

<p>Retief turned to find himself face-to-face with Ambassador
Crodfoller.</p>

<p>"I witnessed that," The Ambassador hissed. "By the goodness of
Providence, the Potentate and his retinue haven't appeared yet. But I
can assure you the servants saw it. A more un-Nenni-like display I would
find it difficult to imagine!"</p>

<p>Retief arranged his features in an expression of deep interest.</p>

<p>"More un-Nenni-like, sir?" he said. "I'm not sure I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah!" The Ambassador glared at Retief, "Your reputation has preceded
you, sir. Your name is associated with a number of the most bizarre
incidents in Corps history. I'm warning you; I'll tolerate nothing." He
turned and stalked away.</p>

<p>"Ambassador-baiting is a dangerous sport, Retief," Magnan said.</p>

<p>Retief took a swallow of his drink. "Still," he said, "it's better
than no sport at all."</p>

<p>"Your time would be better spent observing the Nenni mannerisms.
Frankly, Retief, you're not fitting into the group at all well."</p>

<p>"I'll be candid with you, Mr. Magnan. The group gives me the
willies."</p>

<p>"Oh, the Nenni are a trifle frivolous, I'll concede," Magnan said.
"But it's with them that we must deal. And you'd be making a
contribution to the overall mission if you merely abandoned that rather
arrogant manner of yours." Magnan looked at Retief critically. "You
can't help your height, of course. But couldn't you curve your back just
a bit&mdash;and possibly assume a more placating expression? Just act a
little more...."</p>

<p>"Girlish?"</p>

<p>"Exactly." Magnan nodded, then looked sharply at Retief.</p>

<p>Retief drained his glass and put it on a passing tray.</p>

<p>"I'm better at acting girlish when I'm well juiced," he said. "But I
can't face another sorghum-and-soda. I suppose it would be un-Nenni-like
to slip the bearer a credit and ask for a Scotch and water."</p>

<p>"Decidedly." Magnan glanced toward a sound across the room.</p>

<p>"Ah, here's the Potentate now!" He hurried off.</p>

<p>Retief watched the bearers coming and going, bringing trays laden
with drinks, carrying off empties. There was a lull in the drinking now,
as the diplomats gathered around the periwigged Chief of State and his
courtiers. Bearers loitered near the service door, eyeing the notables.
Retief strolled over to the service door, pushed through it into a
narrow white-tiled hall filled with the odors of the kitchen. Silent
servants gaped as he passed, watching as he moved along to the kitchen
door and stepped inside.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="initial">A dozen or more low-caste Petreacans, gathered around
a long table in the center of the room looked up, startled. A heap of
long-bladed bread knives, French knives, carving knives and cleavers lay
in the center of the table. Other knives were thrust into belts or held
in the hands of the men. A fat man in the yellow sarong of a cook stood
frozen in the act of handing a knife to a tall one-eyed sweeper.</p>

<p>Retief took one glance, then let his eyes wander to a far corner of
the room. Humming a careless little tune, he sauntered across to the
open liquor shelves, selected a garish green bottle and turned
unhurriedly back toward the door. The group of servants watched him,
transfixed.</p>

<p>As Retief reached the door, it swung inward. Magnan, lips pursed,
stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"I had a premonition," he said.</p>

<p>"I'll bet it was a dandy," Retief said. "You must tell me all about
it&mdash;in the salon."</p>

<p>"We'll have this out right here," Magnan snapped. "I've warned you!"
Magnan's voice trailed off as he took in the scene around the table.</p>

<p>"After you," Retief said, nudging Magnan toward the door.</p>

<p>"What's going on here?" Magnan barked. He stared at the men, started
around Retief. A hand stopped him.</p>

<p>"Let's be going," Retief said, propelling Magnan toward the hall.</p>

<p>"Those knives!" Magnan yelped. "Take your hands off me, Retief! What
are you men&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Retief glanced back. The fat cook gestured suddenly, and the men faded
back. The cook stood, arm cocked, a knife across his palm.</p>

<p>"Close the door and make no sound," he said softly.</p>

<p>Magnan pressed back against Retief. "Let's ... r-run...." he
faltered.</p>

<p>Retief turned slowly, put his hands up.</p>

<p>"I don't run very well with a knife in my back," he said. "Stand very
still, Magnan, and do just what he tells you."</p>

<p>"Take them out through the back," the cook said.</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" Magnan spluttered. "Here, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence," the cook said, almost casually. Magnan gaped at him,
closed his mouth.</p>

<p>Two of the men with knives came to Retief's side and gestured,
grinning broadly.</p>

<p>"Let's go, peacocks," one said.</p>

<p>Retief and Magnan silently crossed the kitchen, went out the back
door, stopped on command and stood waiting. The sky was brilliant with
stars. A gentle breeze stirred the tree-tops beyond the garden. Behind
them the servants talked in low voices.</p>

<p>"You go too, Illy," the cook was saying.</p>

<p>"Do it here," another said.</p>

<p>"And carry their damn dead bodies down?"</p>

<p>"Pitch 'em behind the hedge."</p>

<p>"I said the river. Three of you is plenty for a couple of Nenni. We
don't know if we want to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're foreigners, not Nenni. We don't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So they're foreign Nenni. Makes no difference. I've seen them. I
need every man here; now get going."</p>

<p>"What about the big guy? He looks tough."</p>

<p>"Him? He waltzed into the room and didn't notice a thing. But watch
the other one."</p>

<p>At a prod from a knife point, Retief moved off down the walk, two of
the escort behind him and Magnan, another going ahead to scout the
way.</p>

<p>Magnan moved closer to Retief.</p>

<p>"Say," he said in a whisper. "That fellow in the lead; isn't he the
one who spilled the drink? The one you took the blame for?"</p>

<p>"That's him, all right. He doesn't seem nervous any more, I
notice."</p>

<p>"You saved him from serious punishment," Magnan said. "He'll be
grateful; he'll let us go."</p>

<p>"Better check with the fellows with the knives before you act on
that."</p>

<p>"Say something to him," Magnan hissed, "Remind him."</p>


<p class="initial"><span class="smcap">The</span> lead man fell back in line with Retief and Magnan.</p>

<p>"These two are scared of you," he said, grinning and jerking a thumb
toward the knife-handlers. "They haven't worked around the Nenni like
me; they don't know you."</p>

<p>"Don't you recognize this gentleman?" Magnan said.</p>

<p>"He did me a favor," the man said. "I remember."</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" Retief asked.</p>

<p>"The revolution. We're taking over now."</p>

<p>"Who's 'we'?"</p>

<p>"The People's Anti-Fascist Freedom League."</p>

<p>"What are all the knives for?"</p>

<p>"For the Nenni; and for all you foreigners."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Magnan gasped.</p>

<p>"We'll slit all the throats at one time. Saves a lot of running
around."</p>

<p>"What time will that be?"</p>

<p>"Just at dawn; and dawn comes early, this time of year. By full
daylight the PAFFL will be in charge."</p>

<p>"You'll never succeed," Magnan said. "A few servants with knives!
You'll all be caught and killed."</p>

<p>"By who, the Nenni?" the man laughed. "You Nenni are a caution."</p>

<p>"But we're not Nenni&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We've watched you; you're the same. You're part of the same
blood-sucking class."</p>

<p>"There are better ways to, uh, adjust differences," Magnan said.
"This killing won't help you, I'll personally see to it that your
grievances are heard in the Corps Courts. I can assure you that the
plight of the downtrodden workers will be alleviated. Equal rights for
all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"These threats won't work," the man said. "You don't scare me."</p>

<p>"Threats? I'm promising
<i>relief</i> to the exploited classes
of Petreac!"</p>

<p>"You must be nuts," the man said. "You trying to upset the system or
something?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that the purpose of your revolution?"</p>

<p>"Look, Nenni, we're tired of you Nenni getting all the graft. We want
our turn. What good would it do us to run Petreac if there's no
loot?"</p>

<p>"You mean you intend to oppress the people? But they're your own
group."</p>

<p>"Group, schmoop. We're taking all the chances; we're doing the work.
We deserve the payoff. You think we're throwing up good jobs for the fun
of it?"</p>

<p>"You're basing a revolt on these cynical premises?"</p>

<p>"Wise up, Nenni. There's never been a revolution for any other
reason."</p>

<p>"Who's in charge of this?" Retief said.</p>

<p>"Shoke, the head chef."</p>

<p>"I mean the big boss. Who tells Shoke what all to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's Zorn. Look out, here's where we start down the slope.
It's slippery."</p>

<p>"Look," Magnan said. "You."</p>

<p>"My name's Illy."</p>

<p>"Mr. Illy, this man showed you mercy when he could have had you
beaten."</p>

<p>"Keep moving. Yeah, I said I was grateful."</p>

<p>"Yes," Magnan said, swallowing hard. "A noble emotion, gratitude. You
won't regret it."</p>

<p>"I always try to pay back a good turn," Illy said. "Watch your step
now on this sea-wall."</p>

<p>"You'll never regret it," Magnan said.</p>

<p>"This is far enough," Illy motioned to one of the knife men. "Give me
your knife, Vug."</p>

<p>The man passed his knife to Illy. There was an odor of sea-mud and
kelp. Small waves slapped against the stones of the sea-wall. The wind
was stronger here.</p>

<p>"I know a neat stroke," Illy said. "Practically painless. Who's
first?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Magnan quavered.</p>

<p>"I <i>said</i> I was grateful. I'll do it myself, give you a nice
clean job. You know these amateurs; botch it up and have a guy floppin'
around, yellin' and spatterin' everybody up."</p>

<p>"I'm first," Retief said. He pushed past Magnan, stopped suddenly,
drove a straight punch at Illy's mouth.</p>

<p class="initial"><span class="smcap">The</span> long blade flicked
harmlessly over Retief's shoulder as Illy fell. Retief whirled, leaped
past Magnan, took the unarmed servant by the throat and belt, lifted him
and slammed him against the third man. Both scrambled, yelped and fell
from the sea-wall into the water.</p>

<p>Retief turned back to Illy. He pulled off the man's belt and strapped
his hands together.</p>

<p>Magnan found his voice.</p>

<p>"You.... we.... they...."</p>

<p>"I know," Retief said.</p>

<p>"We've got to get back," Magnan said, "Warn them!"</p>

<p>"We'd never get through the rebel cordon around the palace. And if we
did, trying to give an alarm would only set the assassinations off
early."</p>

<p>"We can't just...."</p>

<p>"We've got to go to the source; this fellow Zorn. Get him to call it
off."</p>

<p>"We'd be killed! At least we're safe here."</p>

<p>Illy groaned and opened his eyes. He sat up.</p>

<p>"On your feet, Illy," Retief said.</p>

<p>Illy looked around. "I'm sick," he said.</p>

<p>"The damp air is bad for you. Let's be going." Retief pulled the man
to his feet. "Where does Zorn stay when he's in town?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"What happened? Where's Vug and...."</p>

<p>"They had an accident. Fell in the pond."</p>

<p>Illy gazed down at the restless black water.</p>

<p>"I guess I had you Nenni figured wrong."</p>

<p>"Us Nenni have hidden qualities. Let's get moving before Vug and Slug
make it to shore and start it all over again."</p>

<p>"No hurry," Illy said. "They can't swim." He spat into the water. "So
long, Vug. So long, Toscin. Take a pull, at the Hell Horn for me." He
started off along the sea wall toward the sound of the surf.</p>

<p>"You want to see Zorn, I'll take you to see Zorn," he said. "I can't
swim either."</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="initial">"I take it," Retief said, "that the casino is a front for his
political activities."</p>

<p>"He makes plenty off it. This PAFFL is a new kick. I never heard
about it until maybe a couple months ago."</p>

<p>Retief motioned toward a dark shed with an open door.</p>

<p>"We'll stop here," he said, "long enough to strip the gadgets off
these uniforms."</p>

<p>Illy, hands strapped behind his back, stood by and watched as Retief
and Magnan removed medals, ribbons, orders and insignia from the formal
diplomatic garments.</p>

<p>"This may help some," Retief said, "if the word is out that two
diplomats are loose."</p>

<p>"It's a breeze," Illy said. "We see cats in purple and orange
tailcoats all the time."</p>

<p>"I hope you're right," Retief said. "But if we're called, you'll be
the first to go, Illy."</p>

<p>"You're a funny kind of Nenni," Illy said, eyeing Retief, "Toscin and
Vug must be wonderin' what happened to 'em."</p>

<p>"If you think I'm good at drowning people, you ought to see me with a
knife. Let's get going."</p>

<p>"It's only a little way now," Illy said. "But you better untie me.
Somebody's liable to stick their nose in and get me killed."</p>

<p>"I'll take the chance. How do we get to the casino?"</p>

<p>"We follow this street. It twists around and goes under a couple
tunnels. When we get to the Drunkard's Stairs we go up and it's right in
front of us. A pink front with a sign like a big Luck Wheel."</p>

<p>"Give me your belt, Magnan," Retief said.</p>

<p>Magnan handed it over.</p>

<p>"Lie down, Illy," Retief said.</p>

<p>The servant looked at Retief.</p>

<p>"Vug and Toscin will be glad to see me," he said. "But they'll never
believe me." He lay down. Retief strapped his feet together and stuffed
a handkerchief in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Why are you doing that?" Magnan asked. "We need him."</p>

<p>"We know the way. And we don't need anyone to announce our arrival.
It's only on three-dee that you can march a man through a gang of his
pals with a finger in his back."</p>

<p>Magnan looked at the man. "Maybe you'd better, uh, cut his throat,"
he said.</p>

<p>Illy rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>"That's a very un-Nenni-like suggestion, Mr. Magnan," Retief said.
"If we have any trouble finding the casino, I'll give it serious
thought."</p>

<p>There were few people in the narrow street. Shops were shuttered,
windows dark.</p>

<p>"Maybe they heard about the coup," Magnan said. "They're lying
low."</p>

<p>"More likely, they're at the palace picking up their knives."</p>

<p>They rounded a corner, stepped over a man curled in the gutter
snoring heavily and found themselves at the foot of a long flight of
littered stone steps.</p>

<p>"The Drunkard's Stairs are plainly marked," Magnan sniffed.</p>

<p>"I hear sounds up there," Retief said. "Sounds of merrymaking."</p>

<p>"Maybe we'd better go back."</p>

<p>"Merrymaking doesn't scare me," Retief said. "Come to think of it, I
don't know what the word means." He started up, Magnan behind him.</p>

<p class="initial"><span class="smcap">At</span> the top of the long
stair a dense throng milled in the alley-like street.</p>

<p>A giant illuminated roulette wheel revolved slowly above them. A
loudspeaker blared the chant of the croupiers from the tables inside.
Magnan and Retief moved through the crowd toward the wide-open
doors.</p>

<p>Magnan plucked at Retief's sleeve. "Are you sure we ought to push
right in like this? Maybe we ought to wait a bit, look around...."</p>

<p>"When you're where you have no business being," Retief said, "always
stride along purposefully. If you loiter, people begin to get
curious."</p>

<p>Inside, a mob packed the wide, low-ceilinged room, clustered around
gambling devices in the form of towers, tables and basins.</p>

<p>"What do we do now?" Magnan asked.</p>

<p>"We gamble. How much money do you have in your pockets?"</p>

<p>"Why ... a few credits." Magnan handed the money to Retief. "But what
about the man Zorn?"</p>

<p>"A purple cutaway is conspicuous enough, without ignoring the
tables," Retief said. "We've got a hundred credits between us. We'll get
to Zorn in due course, I hope."</p>

<p>"Your pleasure, gents," a bullet-headed man said, eyeing the colorful
evening clothes of the diplomats. "You'll be wantin' to try your luck at
the Zoop tower, I'd guess. A game for real sporting gents."</p>

<p>"Why ... ah ..." Magnan said.</p>

<p>"What's a zoop tower?" Retief asked.</p>

<p>"Out-of-towners, hey?" The bullet-headed man shifted his dope-stick
to the other corner of his mouth. "Zoop is a great little game. Two
teams of players buy into the pot. Each player takes a lever; the object
is to make the ball drop from the top of the tower into your net.
Okay?"</p>

<p>"What's the ante?"</p>

<p>"I got a hundred-credit pot workin' now, gents."</p>

<p>Retief nodded. "We'll try it."</p>

<p>The shill led the way to an eight-foot tower mounted on gimbals. Two
perspiring men in trade-class pullovers gripped two of the levers that
controlled the tilt of the tower. A white ball lay in a hollow in the
thick glass platform at the top. From the center, an intricate pattern
of grooves led out to the edge of the glass. Retief and Magnan took
chairs before the two free levers.</p>

<p>"When the light goes on, gents, work the lever to jack the tower. You
got three gears. Takes a good arm to work top gear. That's this button
here. The little knob controls what way you're goin'. May the best team
win. I'll take the hundred credits now."</p>

<p class="initial"><span class="smcap">Retief</span> handed over the
money. A red light flashed on, and Retief tried the lever.</p>

<p>It moved easily, with a ratcheting sound. The tower trembled, slowly
tilted toward the two perspiring workmen pumping frantically at their
levers. Magnan started slowly, accelerated as he saw the direction the
tower was taking.</p>

<p>"Faster, Retief," he said. "They're winning."</p>

<p>"This is against the clock, gents," the bullet-headed man said. "If
nobody wins when the light goes off, the house takes all."</p>

<p>"Crank it over to the left," Retief said.</p>

<p>"I'm getting tired."</p>

<p>"Shift to a lower gear."</p>

<p>The tower leaned. The ball stirred, rolled into a concentric channel.
Retief shifted to middle gear, worked the lever. The tower creaked to a
stop, started back upright.</p>

<p>"There isn't any lower gear," Magnan gasped. One of the two on the
other side of the tower shifted to middle gear; the other followed suit.
They worked harder now, heaving against the stiff levers. The tower
quivered, moved slowly toward their side.</p>

<p>"I'm exhausted," Magnan gasped. He dropped the lever, lolled back in
the chair, gulping air. Retief shifted position, took Magnan's lever
with his left hand.</p>

<p>"Shift it to middle gear," Retief said. Magnan gulped, punched the
button and slumped back, panting.</p>

<p>"My arm," he said. "I've injured myself."</p>

<p>The two men in pullovers conferred hurriedly as they cranked their
levers; then one punched a button and the other reached across, using
his left arm to help.</p>

<p>"They've shifted to high," Magnan said. "Give up, it's hopeless."</p>

<p>"Shift me to high," Retief said. "Both buttons!"</p>

<p>Magnan complied. Retief's shoulders bulged. He brought one lever
down, then the other, alternately, slowly at first, then faster. The
tower jerked, tilted toward him, farther.... The ball rolled in the
channel, found an outlet&mdash;</p>

<p>Abruptly, both Retief's levers froze.</p>

<p>The tower trembled, wavered and moved back. Retief heaved. One lever
folded at the base, bent down and snapped off short. Retief braced his
feet, took the other lever with both hands and pulled.</p>

<p>There was a rasp of metal friction, and a loud twang. The lever came
free, a length of broken cable flopping into view. The tower fell over
as the two on the other side scrambled aside.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Bullet-head yelled. "You wrecked my equipment!"</p>

<p>Retief got up and faced him.</p>

<p>"Does Zorn know you've got your tower rigged for suckers?"</p>

<p>"You tryin' to call me a cheat or something?"</p>

<p>The crowd had fallen back, ringing the two men. Bullet-head glanced
around. With a lightning motion, he plucked a knife from somewhere.</p>

<p>"That'll be five hundred credits for the equipment," he said. "Nobody
calls Kippy a cheat."</p>

<p class="initial"><span class="smcap">Retief</span> picked up the
broken lever.</p>

<p>"Don't make me hit you with this, you cheap chiseler."</p>

<p>Kippy looked at the bar.</p>

<p>"Comin' in here," he said indignantly, looking to the crowd for
support. "Bustin' up my rig, callin' names...."</p>

<p>"I want a hundred credits," Retief said. "Now."</p>

<p>"Highway robbery!" Kippy yelled.</p>

<p>"Better pay up," somebody called.</p>

<p>"Hit him, mister," someone else said.</p>

<p>A broad-shouldered man with graying hair pushed through the crowd and
looked around. "You heard 'em, Kippy. Give," he said.</p>

<p>The shill growled but tucked his knife away. Reluctantly he peeled a
bill from a fat roll and handed it over.</p>

<p>The newcomer looked from Retief to Magnan.</p>

<p>"Pick another game, strangers," he said. "Kippy made a little
mistake."</p>

<p>"This is small-time stuff," Retief said. "I'm interested in something
big."</p>

<p>The broad-shouldered man lit a perfumed dope stick. "What would you
call big?" he said softly.</p>

<p>"What's the biggest you've got?"</p>

<p>The man narrowed his eyes, smiling. "Maybe you'd like to try
Slam."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Over here." The crowd opened up, made a path. Retief and Magnan
followed across the room to a brightly-lit glass-walled box.</p>

<p>There was an arm-sized opening at waist height. Inside was a hand
grip. A two-foot plastic globe a quarter full of chips hung in the
center. Apparatus was mounted at the top of the box.</p>

<p>"Slam pays good odds," the man said. "You can go as high as you like.
Chips cost you a hundred credits. You start it up by dropping a chip in
here." He indicated a slot.</p>

<p>"You take the hand grip. When you squeeze, it unlocks. The globe
starts to turn. You can see, it's full of chips. There's a hole at the
top. As long as you hold the grip, the bowl turns. The harder you
squeeze, the faster it turns. Eventually it'll turn over to where the
hole is down, and chips fall out.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, there's contact plates spotted around the bowl.
When one of 'em lines up with a live contact, you get quite a little
jolt&mdash;guaranteed nonlethal. All you've got to do is hold on long
enough, and you'll get the payoff."</p>

<p>"How often does this random pattern put the hole down?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere from three minutes to fifteen, with the average run of
players. Oh, by the way, one more thing. That lead block up
there&mdash;" The man motioned with his head toward a one-foot cube
suspended by a thick cable. "It's rigged to drop every now and again.
Averages five minutes. A warning light flashes first. You can take a
chance; sometimes the light's a bluff. You can set the clock back on it
by dropping another chip&mdash;or you can let go the grip."</p>

<p>Retief looked at the massive block of metal.</p>

<p>"That would mess up a man's dealing hand, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"The last two jokers who were too cheap to feed the machine had to
have 'em off. Their arms, I mean. That lead's heavy stuff."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose your machine has a habit of getting stuck, like
Kippy's?"</p>

<p>The broad-shouldered man frowned.</p>

<p>"You're a stranger," he said, "You don't know any better."</p>

<p>"It's a fair game, Mister," someone called.</p>

<p>"Where do I buy the chips?"</p>

<p>The man smiled. "I'll fix you up. How many?"</p>

<p>"One."</p>

<p>"A big spender, eh?" The man snickered, but handed over a large
plastic chip.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="initial"><span class="smcap">Retief</span> stepped to the
machine, dropped the coin.</p>

<p>"If you want to change your mind," the man said, "you can back out
now. All it'll cost you is the chip you dropped."</p>

<p>Retief reached through the hole, took the grip. It was leather padded
hand-filling. He squeezed it. There was a click and bright lights sprang
up. The crowd ah!-ed. The globe began to twirl lazily. The four-inch
hole at its top was plainly visible.</p>

<p>"If ever the hole gets in position it will empty very quickly,"
Magnan said, hopefully.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a brilliant white light flooded the glass cage. A sound
went up from the spectators.</p>

<p>"Quick, drop a chip," someone called.</p>

<p>"You've only got ten seconds...."</p>

<p>"Let go!" Magnan yelped.</p>

<p>Retief sat silent, holding the grip, frowning up at the weight. The
globe twirled faster now. Then the bright white light winked off.</p>

<p>"A bluff!" Magnan gasped.</p>

<p>"That's risky, stranger," the gray-templed man said.</p>

<p>The globe was turning rapidly now, oscillating from side to side. The
hole seemed to travel in a wavering loop, dipping lower, swinging up
high, then down again.</p>

<p>"It has to move to the bottom soon," Magnan said. "Slow it down."</p>

<p>"The slower it goes, the longer it takes to get to the bottom,"
someone said.</p>

<p>There was a crackle and Retief stiffened. Magnan heard a sharp intake
of breath. The globe slowed, and Retief shook his head, blinking.</p>

<p>The broad-shouldered man glanced at a meter.</p>

<p>"You took pretty near a full jolt, that time," he said.</p>

<p>The hole in the globe was tracing an oblique course now, swinging to
the center, then below.</p>

<p>"A little longer," Magnan said.</p>

<p>"That's the best speed I ever seen on the Slam ball," someone said.
"How much longer can he hold it?"</p>

<p>Magnan looked at Retief's knuckles. They showed white against the
grip. The globe tilted farther, swung around, then down; two chips fell
out, clattered down a chute and into a box.</p>

<p>"We're ahead," Magnan said. "Let's quit."</p>

<p>Retief shook his head. The globe rotated, dipped again; three chips
fell.</p>

<p>"She's ready," someone called.</p>

<p>"It's bound to hit soon," another voice added excitedly. "Come on,
Mister!"</p>

<p>"Slow down," Magnan said. "So it won't move past too quickly."</p>

<p>"Speed it up, before that lead block gets you," someone called.</p>

<p>The hole swung high, over the top, then down the side. Chips rained
out of the hole, six, eight....</p>

<p>"Next pass," a voice called.</p>

<p>The white light flooded the cage. The globe whirled; the hole slid
over the top, down, down.... A chip fell, two more....</p>

<p>Retief half rose, clamped his jaw and crushed the grip. Sparks flew.
The globe slowed, chips spewing. It stopped, swung back, weighted by the
mass of chips at the bottom, and stopped again with the hole
centered.</p>

</div>

<p>Chips cascaded down the chute, filled the box before Retief, spilled
on the floor. The crowd yelled.</p>

<p>Retief released the grip and withdrew his arm at the same instant
that the lead block slammed down.</p>

<p>"Good lord," Magnan said. "I felt that through the floor."</p>

<p>Retief turned to the broad-shouldered man.</p>

<p>"This game's all right for beginners," he said. "But I'd like to talk
a really big gamble. Why don't we go to your office, Mr. Zorn?"</p>

<p class="initial">"Y<span class="smcap">our</span> proposition
interests me," Zorn said, grinding out the stump of his dope stick in a
brass ashtray. "But there's some angles to this I haven't mentioned
yet."</p>

<p>"You're a gambler, Zorn, not a suicide," Retief said. "Take what I've
offered. The other idea was fancier, I agree, but it won't work."</p>

<p>"How do I know you birds aren't lying?" Zorn snarled. He stood up,
strode up and down the room. "You walk in here and tell me I'll have a
task force on my neck, that the Corps won't recognize my regime. Maybe
you're right. But I've got other contacts. They say different." He
whirled, stared at Retief.</p>

<p>"I have pretty good assurance that once I put it over, the Corps will
have to recognize me as the legal government of Petreac. They won't
meddle in internal affairs."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Magnan spoke up. "The Corps will never deal with a pack
of criminals calling themselves&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Watch your language, you!" Zorn rasped.</p>

<p>"I'll admit Mr. Magnan's point is a little weak," Retief said. "But
you're overlooking something. You plan to murder a dozen or so officers
of the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne along with the local wheels. The
corps won't overlook that. It can't."</p>

<p>"Their tough luck they're in the middle," Zorn muttered.</p>

<p>"Our offer is extremely generous, Mr. Zorn," Magnan said. "The post
you'll get will pay you very well indeed. As against the certain failure
of your planned coup, the choice should be simple."</p>

<p>Zorn eyed Magnan. "Offering me a job&mdash;it sounds phony as hell. I
thought you birds were goody-goody diplomats."</p>

<p>"It's time you knew," Retief said. "There's no phonier business in
the Galaxy than diplomacy."</p>

<p>"You'd better take it, Mr. Zorn," Magnan said.</p>

<p>"Don't push me, Junior!" Zorn said. "You two walk into my
headquarters empty-handed and big-mouthed. I don't know what I'm talking
to you for. The answer is no. N-I-X, no!"</p>

<p>"Who are you afraid of?" Retief said softly.</p>

<p>Zorn glared at him.</p>

<p>"Where do you get that 'afraid' routine? I'm top man here!"</p>

<p>"Don't kid around, Zorn. Somebody's got you under their thumb. I can
see you squirming from here."</p>

<p class="initial">"W<span class="smcap">hat</span> if I let your boys
alone?" Zorn said suddenly. "The Corps won't have anything to say then,
huh?"</p>

<p>"The Corps has plans for Petreac, Zorn. You aren't part of them. A
revolution right now isn't part of them. Having the Potentate and the
whole Nenni caste slaughtered isn't part of them. Do I make myself
clear?"</p>

<p>"Listen," Zorn said urgently, pulling a chair around. "I'll tell you
guys a few things. You ever heard of a world they call Rotune?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Magnan said. "It's a near neighbor of yours. Another
backward&mdash;that is, emergent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Okay," Zorn said. "You guys think I'm a piker, do you? Well, let me
wise you up. The Federal Junta on Rotune is backing my play. I'll be
recognized by Rotune, and the Rotune fleet will stand by in case I need
any help. I'll present the CDT with what you call a <i>fait
accompli</i>."</p>

<p>"What does Rotune get out of this? I thought they were your
traditional enemies."</p>

<p>"Don't get me wrong. I've got no use for Rotune; but our interests
happen to coincide right now."</p>

<p>"Do they?" Retief smiled grimly. "You can spot a sucker as soon as he
comes through that door out there&mdash;but you go for a deal like
this!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Zorn looked angrily at Retief. "It's
fool-proof."</p>

<p>"After you get in power, you'll be fast friends with Rotune, is that
it?"</p>

<p>"Friends, hell! Just give me time to get set, and I'll square a few
things with that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly. And what do you suppose they have in mind for you?"</p>

<p>"What are you getting at?"</p>

<p>"Why is Rotune interested in your take-over?"</p>

<p>Zorn studied Retief's face. "I'll tell you why," he said. "It's you
birds. You and your trade agreement. You're here to tie Petreac into
some kind of trade combine. That cuts Rotune out. Well, we're doing all
right out here. We don't need any commitments to a lot of fancy-pants on
the other side of the Galaxy."</p>

<p>"That's what Rotune has sold you, eh?" Retief said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Sold, nothing!"</p>

<p class="initial">Z<span class="smcap">orn</span> ground out his dope-stick, lit another. He snorted angrily.</p>

<p>"Okay; what's your idea?" he asked after a moment.</p>

<p>"You know what Petreac is getting in the way of imports as a result
of the agreement?"</p>

<p>"Sure. A lot of junk."</p>

<p>"To be specific," Retief said, "there'll be 50,000 Tatone B-3 dry
washers; 100,000 Glo-float motile lamps; 100,000 Earthworm Minor garden
cultivators; 25,000 Veco space heaters; and 75,000 replacement elements
for Ford Monomeg drives."</p>

<p>"Like I said. A lot of junk."</p>

<p>Retief leaned back, looking sardonically at Zorn, "Here's the
gimmick, Zorn," he said. "The Corps is getting a little tired of Petreac
and Rotune carrying on their two-penny war out here. Your privateers
have a nasty habit of picking on innocent bystanders. After studying
both sides, the Corps has decided Petreac would be a little easier to do
business with. So this trade agreement was worked out. The Corps can't
openly sponsor an arms shipment to a belligerent. But personal
appliances are another story."</p>

<p>"So what do we do&mdash;plow 'em under with back-yard cultivators?"
Zorn looked at Retief, puzzled. "What's the point?"</p>

<p>"You take the sealed monitor unit from the washer, the repeller field
generator from the lamp, the converter control from the cultivator, et
cetera, et cetera. You fit these together according to some very simple
instructions. Presto! You have one hundred thousand Standard-class Y
hand blasters. Just the thing to turn the tide in a stalemated war
fought with obsolete arms."</p>

<p>"Good lord!" Magnan said. "Retief, are you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have to tell him," Retief said. "He has to know what he's putting
his neck into."</p>

<p>"Weapons, hey?" Zorn said. "And Rotune knows about it?"</p>

<p>"Sure they know about it. It's not too hard to figure out. And
there's more. They want the CDT delegation included in the massacre for
a reason. It will put Petreac out of the picture; the trade agreement
will go to Rotune; and you and your new regime will find yourselves
looking down the muzzles of your own blasters."</p>

<p>Zorn threw his dope-stick to the floor with a snarl.</p>

<p>"I should have smelled something when that Rotune smoothie made his
pitch." Zorn looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I've got two hundred armed men in the palace. We've got about forty
minutes to get over there before the rocket goes up."</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class="initial">"Y<span class="smcap">ou'd</span> better stay here on
this terrace out of the way until I've spread the word," Zorn said.
"Just in case."</p>

<p>"Let me caution you against any ... ah ... slip-ups, Mr. Zorn,"
Magnan said. "The Nenni are not to be molested&mdash;"</p>

<p>Zorn looked at Retief.</p>

<p>"Your friend talks too much," he said. "I'll keep my end of it. He'd
better keep his."</p>

<p>"Nothing's happened yet, you're sure?" Magnan said.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," Zorn said. "Ten minutes to go. Plenty of time."</p>

<p>"I'll just step into the salon to assure myself that all is well,"
Magnan said.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," Zorn said. "Just stay clear of the kitchen, or
you'll get your throat cut." He sniffed at his dope-stick. "What's
keeping Shoke?" he muttered.</p>

<p>Magnan stepped to a tall glass door, eased it open and poked his head
through the heavy draperies. As he moved to draw back, a voice was
faintly audible. Magnan paused, head still through the drapes.</p>

<p>"What's going on there?" Zorn rasped. He and Retief stepped up behind
Magnan.</p>

<p>"&mdash;breath of air, ha-ha," Magnan was saying.</p>

<p>"Well, come along, Magnan!" Ambassador Crodfoller's voice
snapped.</p>

<p>Magnan shifted from one foot to the other then pushed through the
drapes.</p>

<p>"Where've you been, Mr. Magnan?" The Ambassador's voice was
sharp.</p>

<p>"Oh ... ah ... a slight accident, Mr. Ambassador."</p>

<p>"What's happened to your shoes? Where are your insignia and
decorations?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ah&mdash;spilled a drink on them. Sir.
Ah&mdash;listen...."</p>

<p>The sound of an orchestra came up suddenly, blaring a fanfare.</p>

<p>Zorn shifted restlessly, ear against the glass.</p>

<p>"What's your friend pulling?" he rasped. "I don't like this."</p>

<p>"Keep cool, Zorn," Retief said. "Mr. Magnan is doing a little
emergency salvage on his career."</p>

<p>The music died away with a clatter.</p>

<p>"&mdash;My God," Ambassador Crodfoller's voice was faint. "Magnan,
you'll be knighted for this. Thank God you reached me. Thank God it's
not too late. I'll find some excuse. I'll get a gram off at once."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's all right, Magnan. You were in time. Another ten minutes and
the agreement would have been signed and transmitted. The wheels would
have been put in motion. My career ruined...."</p>

<p>Retief felt a prod at his back. He turned.</p>

<p>"Doublecrossed," Zorn said softly. "So much for the word of a
diplomat."</p>

<p class="initial">R<span class="smcap">etief</span> looked at the
short-barreled needler in Zorn's hand.</p>

<p>"I see you hedge your bets, Zorn," he said.</p>

<p>"We'll wait here," Zorn said, "until the excitement's over inside. I
wouldn't want to attract any attention right now."</p>

<p>"Your politics are still lousy, Zorn. The picture hasn't changed.
Your coup hasn't got a chance."</p>

<p>"Skip it. I'll take up one problem at a time."</p>

<p>"Magnan's mouth has a habit of falling open at the wrong
time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's my good luck that I heard it. So there'll be no agreement, no
guns, no fat job for Tammany Zorn, hey? Well, I can still play it the
other way, What have I got to lose?"</p>

<p>With a movement too quick to follow, Retief's hand chopped down
across Zorn's wrist. The needler clattered as Zorn reeled, and then
Retief's hand clamped Zorn's arm and whirled him around.</p>

<p>"In answer to your last question," Retief said, "your neck."</p>

<p>"You haven't got a chance, doublecrosser," Zorn gasped.</p>

<p>"Shoke will be here in a minute," Retief said. "Tell him it's all
off."</p>

<p>"Twist harder, Mister," Zorn said. "Break it off at the shoulder. I'm
telling him nothing!"</p>

<p>"The kidding's over, Zorn," Retief said. "Call it off or I'll kill
you."</p>

<p>"I believe you," Zorn said. "But you won't have long to remember
it."</p>

<p>"All the killing will be for nothing," Retief said. "You'll be dead
and the Rotunes will step into the power vacuum."</p>

<p>"So what? When I die, the world ends."</p>

<p>"Suppose I make you another offer, Zorn?"</p>

<p>"Why would it be any better than the last one, chiseler?"</p>

<p>Retief released Zorn's arm, pushed him away, stooped and picked up
the needler.</p>

<p>"I could kill you, Zorn. You know that."</p>

<p>"Go ahead!"</p>

<p>Retief reversed the needler, held it out.</p>

<p>"I'm a gambler too, Zorn. I'm gambling you'll listen to what I have
to say."</p>

<p>Zorn snatched the gun, stepped back. He looked at Retief.</p>

<p>"That wasn't the smartest bet you ever made, Mister; but go ahead.
You've got maybe ten seconds."</p>

<p>"Nobody doublecrossed you, Zorn. Magnan put his foot in it. Too bad.
Is that a reason to kill yourself and a lot of other people who've bet
their lives on you?"</p>

<p>"They gambled and lost. Tough."</p>

<p>"Maybe you haven't lost yet&mdash;if you don't quit."</p>

<p>"Get to the point!"</p>

<p>Retief spoke earnestly for a minute and a half. Zorn stood, gun
aimed, listening. Then both men turned as footsteps approached along the
terrace. A fat man in a yellow sarong padded up to Zorn.</p>

<p>Zorn tucked the needler in his waistband.</p>

<p>"Hold everything, Shoke," he said. "Tell the boys to put the knives
away. Spread the word fast. It's all off."</p>

<p class="initial">"I want to commend you, Retief," Ambassador
Crodfoller said expansively. "You mixed very well at last night's
affair. Actually, I was hardly aware of your presence."</p>

<p>"I've been studying Mr. Magnan's work," Retief said.</p>

<p>"A good man, Magnan. In a crowd, he's virtually invisible."</p>

<p>"He knows when to disappear all right."</p>

<p>"This has been in many ways a model operation, Retief." The
Ambassador patted his paunch contentedly. "By observing local social
customs and blending harmoniously with the court, I've succeeded in
establishing a fine, friendly, working relationship with the
Potentate."</p>

<p>"I understand the agreement has been postponed."</p>

<p>The Ambassador chuckled. "The Potentate's a crafty one. Through ...
ah ... a special study I have been conducting, I learned last night that
he had hoped to, shall I say, 'put one over' on the Corps."</p>

<p>"Great heavens," Retief said.</p>

<p>"Naturally, this placed me in a difficult position. It was my task to
quash this gambit, without giving any indication that I was aware of its
existence."</p>

<p>"A hairy position indeed," Retief said.</p>

<p>"Quite casually, I informed the Potentate that certain items which
had been included in the terms of the agreement had been deleted and
others substituted. I admired him at that moment, Retief. He took it
coolly&mdash;appearing completely indifferent&mdash;perfectly
dissembling his very serious disappointment."</p>

<p>"I noticed him dancing with three girls wearing a bunch of grapes
apiece. He's very agile for a man of his bulk."</p>

<p>"You mustn't discount the Potentate! Remember, beneath that mask of
frivolity, he had absorbed a bitter blow."</p>

<p>"He had me fooled," Retief said.</p>

<p>"Don't feel badly; I confess at first I failed to sense his
shrewdness." The Ambassador nodded and moved off along the corridor.</p>

<p>Retief turned and went into an office. Magnan looked up from his
desk.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said. "Retief. I've been meaning to ask you. About the ...
ah ... blasters. Are you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Retief leaned on Magnan's desk, looked at him.</p>

<p>"I thought that was to be our little secret."</p>

<p>"Well, naturally I&mdash;" Magnan closed his mouth, swallowed. "How
is it, Retief," he said sharply, "that you were aware of this blaster
business, when the Ambassador himself wasn't?"</p>

<p>"Easy," Retief said. "I made it up."</p>

<p>"You what!" Magnan looked wild. "But the agreement&mdash;it's been
revised! Ambassador Crodfoller has gone on record...."</p>

<p>"Too bad. Glad <i>I</i> didn't tell him about it."</p>

<p class="initial">M<span class="smcap">agnan</span> leaned back and
closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"It was big of you to take all the ... blame," Retief said, "when the
Ambassador was talking about knighting people."</p>

<p>Magnan opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"What about that gambler, Zorn? Won't he be upset?"</p>

<p>"It's all right," Retief said, "I made another arrangement. The
business about making blasters out of common components wasn't
completely imaginary. You can actually do it, using parts from an
old-fashioned disposal unit."</p>

<p>"What good will that do him?" Magnan whispered, looking nervous.
"We're not shipping in any old-fashioned disposal units."</p>

<p>"We don't need to," Retief said. "They're already installed in the
palace kitchen&mdash;and in a few thousand other places, Zorn tells
me."</p>

<p>"If this ever leaks...." Magnan put a hand to his forehead.</p>

<p>"I have his word on it that the Nenni slaughter is out. This place is
ripe for a change. Maybe Zorn is what it needs."</p>

<p>"But how can we <i>know?</i>" Magnan yelped. "How can we be
sure?"</p>

<p>"We can't," Retief said. "But it's not up to the Corps to meddle in
Petreacs' internal affairs." He leaned over, picked up Magnan's desk
lighter and lit a cigar. He blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling.
"Right?"</p>

<p>Magnan looked at him, nodded weakly. "Right."</p>

<p>"I'd better be getting along to my desk," Retief said. "Now that the
Ambassador feels that I'm settling down at last&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Retief," Magnan said, "tonight, I implore you. Stay out of the
kitchen&mdash;no matter what."</p>

<p>Retief raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I know," Magnan said. "If you hadn't interfered, we'd all have had
our throats cut. But at least," he added, "we'd have died in accordance
with regulations!"</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
